# Welcome to my practice zone.
### I target safaricom internship
My name is Peter Kiarie , a student who is passionate about solving problems. I pursue a bachelors in Computer Science.
I really want to master Algorithms and data structures. I begun 3 months ago doing them in c++ and now I can do basic easy questions.
When I will be ready in c++ then will I move to solving them in *python* and other cool languages like *Java*
